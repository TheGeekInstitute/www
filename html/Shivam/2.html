    <p><mark>Humans</mark> have always<mark>  needed</mark> to perform<mark> arithmetics</mark> operations<mark> like counting and adding</mark>.<br>The gradual evolution of arthmetic methods lead to the evolution of certain machines, futher<mark>  leading to the evolution of present-day</mark>  computer.</p>
    <h3><b><u>ABACUS(3003BC)</b></u></h3>
    <ul><li>The abacus  is invented in 3000 BC in Babylonia.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Its consists of beads on roads to count and calculate.</li>
    <br>
    <li>It is still widely used in Asia.</li></ul>
    <h3><u>SLIDE RULE(1630BC)</u></h3>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>Slide rule was invented in 1630 Bc.
    <li>It was base on Napier's rules for Logarithms.</li>
     <li>It was use till the 1970s.</li>  </ul>
    <h3><u>PASCAL'S ADDING MACHINE(1642AD)</u></h3>
    <ul type="square">
    <li>In 1642 AD, Blaise Pascal, a French mathmatician, invented a calculating machine named<mark> Adding Machine.</mark></li>
    <li>This machine was capable doing addition and subtraction. This device know as a <mark>First Calculator of the world.</mark></li></ul>
<h3><u>LEIBNITZ'S CALCULATOR(1671AD)</u></h3>
    <ul type="square">
    <li> 1671 AD, Gottifried Leibnitz, a German Mathematiocs, improved the adding Machine Capable of performing multiplication and division also.</li>
    </ul>
<h3><u>JACQUARD LOOM(1801AD)</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <A href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">thIS IS A LINK</A>
<li>This machine first gave the concept of stored program using metal cards.</li>
<li>It was the first camputer manufacture.</li>
<li>It is still in use today.</li>
    </ul>
<H3><u>BABBAE'S DIFFRENCE ENGINE</u></H3>
   <img src="Babbage machin.jpg">

   <ul>
<li>Charles Babbage was a Brithis Mathematician. In 1822, he degines a machine called Diffrence Engine. It aimed at calculating mathematical tables.</li>
<li>Since technology wqas not so advanced at that time, this machine could not be made.</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>BABBAGE'S ANALYTICAL ENGINE</u></h3>

<UL>
    <li>In 1833, charles Babbage degine a machine called Analytica Engine. It had almost all the part of the moder computers. Unfortunately, this machine chould not be build because of lack of tecnology. His designs remain a concept.</li>
    <li>Babbage"s great designs earned him the titel of 'father of computers'.</li>
</UL>


<h3><u>HOLLERITH'S TABULATING MACHINE</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hollerith, a mathematicians invented a first counting machine named Tabulating Machine in 1880.</li>
        <li>This machine was used by the American Department of census to complete their 1880 census data.</li>
    </ul>
<h3><u>MARK I COMPUTER</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Howard aiken of Harver University in USA joined hands with IBM.</li>
        <li>He development a computer named Mrks I 1943.</li>
        <li>It could perform mathematical operations very fast.</li>
        <li>It could perform one operations per second.</li>
    </ul>

<h3><u>ENIAC</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The first electronic computer, ENIAC was developed in 1946 by a team led by professor Eckert and Mauchly atb the University of Pennsylvania in USA.</li>
        <li>Electronc Numerical Integrator and computer (ENIAC) was very fast. 
        </li>
        <li>It could solve 5000 oprations per second.</li>
    </ul>
 
<h3><u>INTEL 8080 PROCESSOR</u></h3>
    <UL>
        <li>In 1974, the Intel 8080 processor was introuced. It became the basis for the first personal computer.</li>
        <li>It was based on john von Neumann Architecture, which is based on "stored Program Concept".</li>
