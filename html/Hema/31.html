    <p class="para">17.1 INTRODUCTION
        The Information, Education & Communication
        (IEC) strategy aims to create awareness and
        disseminate information regarding the benefits
        available under various schemes/programmes of
        the Ministry and to guide the citizens on how to
        access them. The objective is also to encourage
        build-up of health seeking behaviour among the
        masses in keeping with the focus on promotive and
        preventive health. The IEC strategy has catered to
        the different needs of the rural and urban masses
        through the various tools used for communication</p>

            PLAN
            The Ministry designed a strategic framework for
            targeted IEC activities encompassing mass media,
            along with mid-media and inter-personal activities
            so as to disseminate information about the various
            health schemes in the masses. The year-long
            IEC/Communication Plan had month-wise focus
            on health days and health themes. While some
            activities were taken up to coincide with ‘Health
            Days’, others were week and month long plans
            for focussed multi-media campaigns on schemes
            of the Ministry. These centered around topics
            such as Integrated Diarrhoea Control Fortnight
            (IDCF), Breastfeeding Week, Tobacco Control
            etc. Seasonal ailments such as Dengue, H1N1 etc.,
            needed campaigns for a longer time.
            All the IEC activities had a print media component </p>
