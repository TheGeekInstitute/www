    <h2>The Cow is a family-owned and operated soft ice cream and burger stand in Alum Bank, Pennsylvania. The Cow was founded in 1958 by Stanley and Dale Claycomb. Stanley was a WWII veteran and small town farmer.</h2>
    
    One Sunday in March of 1958, Dale mentioned to Stanely that she would like to open an ice cream stand when her, Stanley, and his brother Ernest passed a root beer shop while heading to Bedford, PA.
    
    Ernest took the idea to heart and came home with plans for an ice cream stand. Stanley and Ernest began to look for land and took out a mortgage of $2000 to get the business off the ground. They bought our famous cow statue in Wisconsin for $1200. 
    
    On <b>June 21, 1958,</b> Dales wish was officially granted and the The Cow was open for business. After a few years, Stanley and Dale bought Ernest's share and became the sole owners. Stanley was told by and industry expert that he'd never do any business at the stand's location, but as hard headed as Stanley was, he tried anyways.
    
    Fifty-eight years later, The Cow is a local legend and wild success. At the 50th anniversary, Stanley was asked if he had any idea that The Cow would be still going strong after 50 years. He replied that he had no idea and that the only thing he knew about the ice cream business when he started was to eat the cone.
