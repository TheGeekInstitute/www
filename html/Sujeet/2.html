<h1>Tips for Self Care</h1>
<h2>Staying mentally healthy is just like staying physically healthy – there are a lot of things we can do. Some things to try are:</h2>
<strong>
    Pay attention to your diet – lots of sugar and processed foods or not drinking enough water can lead to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and inability to focus
    Get sleep. Being tired can ruin our best attempts for self-care.
    Take time away from technology.  Talking in person through something tough or sharing an experience with a friend helps us connect and be present
    Notice your thoughts. Are you being mean to yourself? Obsessing over something instead of taking action? Try treating yourself as well as you would a good friend.
    Exercise – physical activity increases blood flow to your brain for better concentration and sleep, creates endorphins (happy chemicals), and helps process feelings like stress and anxiety.
    Trust your instincts if your thoughts or feelings are getting overwhelming. Talk with a friend or someone you trust, and if you need to, you can connect with us, a doctor, or therapist for additional support.
