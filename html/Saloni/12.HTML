                Trying to think as much the same,
                Looking above the rainy clouds,
                Smiling at birds that make those sounds,
                Following my footsteps down the lane,
                Giving in to my ball and chain,
                Glancing upon the tall sycamore,
                Dreaming of better times forever more,
                This face I show can only tell,
                The life I have inside my shell,
                The footsteps down that lane,
                I stood there and waited for that train.
