    <p class="new">  His hands
        are firmly wedged
        inside pockets
        unwilling to risk
        exposure to this
        frost-coated morning
        if he tripped
        or slipped
        stumbled
        fell
        even then
        he would not rely
        on their numbed support
        he could not trust
        that they would do
        what was necessary
        if called upon
        deep in the sherpa-lined
        abyss of his coat
        his fingers remain
        protected in gloves
        clenched and wriggling
        with all hopes resting
        on a return
           of warmth
           of bloodflow
           of feeling
        before he gets home
        before central heating
           and chill-blains
        turn his frozen tips
        into scalding rods
        when there is
        no use but
        to desperately
        and ironically wish
        that he could not
        feel anything
        at all
      
        </p>
        
    
    <p class="para">he ice breaks from above me
        as sunlight streams in
        i feel its warmth
        kissing the hairs against my arms
        i would swim
        to the top
        to bang my fists against the frozen sheet
        to pry each shard away
        to pull myself out
        but my blood hardens beneath the flesh
        and i sink
        watching the sky from the cold currents.
       </p>

    <p class="old">Like a 21st century Snow White in her crystal casket,
        You can find me in the frozen aisle, lying on a bed of ice cream tubs and chicken kievs,
        Unconcious.
        
        Slide the plexiglass door open,
        Pick me up.
        Do not worry if your freezer looks too small,
        I can bend, I can fold.
        You can consume me tonight, tomorrow, next week, six months from now and I won't expire.
        
        It doesn't take too much to cook me,
        Yet it shows you haven't done enough cooking in your life to know
        That once meat is defrosted, you can't freeze it again and expect it to taste good.</p>

    <p class="mix"> The dry tundra calls to you
        Whispering a phrase
        A memory that flows
        In between and through
        The forest needle and pine
        Something lies beyond
        Far past the snow and sterile ice
        Over the great mountains
        The places of our birth
        Nothing more than an inclination
        That all we hope there to be
        Has not yet been made know
        That the secret hidden for ages
        Has in turn hidden us within it
        Preserving us in a way unseen
        That when the time does come
        In far flung ages hence
        All things might be revealed
        And the barren wastes
        Turn to fruitful gardens</p>
