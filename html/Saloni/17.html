He said the Frozen earned PG rating because of its “mild action and rude humor”. Frozen was a movie which me and my family enjoyed watching after a long time.
            In the article, “Disney's Frozen” by Katey Rich she gives summary about movie and the characters. She said mostly Disney make movies that pressures teenagers but Frozen is different. She said, “Big animated movies are under crazy </p>
