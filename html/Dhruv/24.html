    <h2>Instagram[a] is a photo and video sharing social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tag and location, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[7]

        Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.[7]
        
        Originally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018.[8] In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.
        History
        For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Instagram.
        
        Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to include even more saturated colors
        Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.[9] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users.[10][11] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of "instant camera" and "telegram".[12]
        
        2010–2011: Beginnings and major funding
        On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[13] Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[14] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[14] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[14][15]
        
        The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010.[16][11] Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later at 9:24 p.m. It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.[17][18][better source needed] On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store.[19]
        
        In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[20] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.[21] In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million valuation.[22] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[23]
        
        2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook
        On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[24][25] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[26] The Android app has since received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[27][28] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were "exploring an iOS version".[29][30][31]
        
        On April 9, 2012, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/"> Facebook,</a> Inc. (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock,[32][33][34] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[35][36][37] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[38] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[39] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[40]
        
        The deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[37] The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[37] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was "committed to building and growing Instagram independently."[37] According to Wired, th</h2>
