        <h1>PARLE-G</h1>
        <p>first came into existence after the Independence of India in 1947. It was an initiative to replace British products with Indian alternatives. Initially, it was sold under the brand name 'Parle Gluco. ' Later, in and around 1980, the name was changed to 'Parle G,' where G stood for Parle Products was founded in 1929 in India by the Chauhan family of Vile Parle, Mumbai. The founder was Mohanlal Chauhan who hailed from Pardi near Valsad in Gujarat. He moved to Mumbai to make a living and at first, his business was tailoring. However, it was not profitable, and so he moved into the food business by selling snacks. He ran a bakery making bread, buns, rusks, scones, nankhatai, turnovers, etc. He had five sons - Maneklal, Pitambar, Narottam, Kantilal and Jayantilal. The five brothers worked together under their father.

            Parle began manufacturing biscuits in 1939, with a license to supply their biscuits only to the British Army. In 1947, when India became independent, the company launched an ad campaign showcasing its Glucose biscuits as an Indian alternative to the British biscuits.[6] The Parle brand became well known in India following the success of products such as the Parle-G biscuits. Much later, in 1977, the Morarji Desai government expelled Coca-Cola from India. The family saw an opportunity here and opened their own cold drinks business, which flourished because there was no competition. It minted money from selling cold beverages like Gold Spot, Thums Up and Frooti, all of which became household names.
            
            The original Parle company was split into three separate companies owned by the different factions of the original Chauhan family, with a majority of it owned by Parle Agro products.</p>
