            <p>India's Ayodhya Temple Is a Huge Monument to Hindu Supremacy. Audrey Truschke is a professor of South Asian history at Rutgers University.

            <p>The Ram Mandir is a Hindu temple under construction in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the hypothesized birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.[6][7]

                The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid which was built in 16th century CE after the demolition of an existing non-Islamic structure. The idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992.
                "The temple has been made to last more than a thousand years," asserts Shri Nripendra Misra, chairperson of the temple construction committee of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, Ayodhya.

                He says top Indian scientists have contributed to making it an iconic structure like never before. Even ISRO technologies have been suitably used in the temple.
