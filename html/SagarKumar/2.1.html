    <p>the
        <a>sedge warbler </a>
        (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus)is a passerine bird in the 
        <a> Acrocephalidae</a>
        family, the reed warblers. It is a medium-sized warbler with a brown, streaked back and wings and a distinct pale
    <a>supercilium</a>
    . Sedge warblers are
    <a>migratory,</a>
    crossing the <a>Sahara </a>
    to get from their European and Asian breeding grounds to spend winter in Africa. The male's song is composed of chattering phrases and can include mimicry of other species. The species is mostly 
    <a> insectivorous</a>
    . This sedge warbler was photographed in 
    <a>Otmoor RSPB reserve</a>in<a>Oxfordshire,</a>England. </p>
